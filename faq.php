                        <p>Yes, all students who come to Clark County School District are required to pass an English Proficiency test before being accepted. Foreign Exchange Students are not allowed to take any English as a Second Language (ESL) classes and instead must attend school as would any American student.</p>

                        <p>We will take care of registering your student with Clark County School District. He/she will be assigned to whichever school you are zoned for. Once the student arrives, you should take him/her to the school for enrollment. You can find which school you’re zoned for <a href="https://www.ccsd.net/schools/zoning/search/">here.</a></p>

                        <p>Students are ages 15-17, come from over 60 countries and are excited to embrace your family’s traditions and the American culture. CCI Greenheart students come from all over Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, and occasionally Mexico!</p>

                        <p>Really the main expense is just an extra plate at the table. Beyond that it is up to the host family if they want to take the student out to travel or see different sites or events. Students come with their own health insurance and spending money for things such as cell phone, clothes, tickets for events, etc.</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>As a host family, we ask that you provide:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Open communication, patience and                            encouragement.</li>

                                </ol>

                    <button class="accordion">What is a typical host family like?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Host parents should be at least 25 years of age or older. Our host families vary greatly and we encourage families of all shapes and sizes to host. Some families have young or teenage children, while others may be empty-nesters or newlyweds. We’ve had single parents, same-sex couples, and grandparents all be wonderful hosts. The most important thing we’ve found is that those who really enjoy the experience are caring, open-minded individuals who want to expand their understanding of the world and other cultures while sharing their American lifestyle with a student from across the globe.</p>

                    <button class="accordion">What if my son or daughter wants to <br >be an exchange student?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>CCI Greenheart only works with inbound students, but Greenheart Travel (another devision of Greenheart International) does send American students on exchange trips around the world through a variety of programs! Students can go during the summer for a Teen Summer Language camp, in the summer to volunteer, or do a school semester or year abroad. For more information on outbound programs, please complete this form.</p>

                    <button class="accordion">What if it doesn’t work out?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>We are committed to making sure that our exchange students and host families have a great experience. If problems ever do arise, we will be there as your local coordinator. In the rare case that we can’t all resolve the issue together, we will find the student a new home.</p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="accordion">How long will the student be with my family?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Exchange students come to the U.S. for either one semester (beginning in August or January) or one school year (usually August to May). Occasionally there are students who come only for a few weeks–especially in the summer.</p>

                    <button class="accordion">How do the students get to school?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Once your student has arrived and you have gone to the school for enrollment, they will inform you if he/she is eligible to take the bus or if other arrangements will need to be made. Generally if you are over 2 miles from the school, your student can ride the bus. You can confirm if you are eligible for the bus <a href="http://trans-webinfo.ccsd.net/InfoLocator/InfoLocator/Locator.aspx?OrgGuid=ORG-CCSD&ProfileGuid=CCSD-PROFILE-3">here.</a></p>

                    <button class="accordion">Do I need to take them on trips?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Families are not required to take students on any sightseeing trip. We will provide several opportunities for your student to travel around. However, most host families enjoy taking their students on trips or around Las Vegas to see the sites. Remember: Las Vegas is a world famous city that students are very excited about! Many families enjoy the extra encouragement to enjoy the many wonderful sights around us.</p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="accordion">Can I take my students shooting?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Yes. Many of the students who come have never had the opportunity to hold/shoot guns and are very excited to go shooting. You will need to get consent from the student’s parents prior to going. Let us know about any plans to go shoot and we will help get it set up and approved.</p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="accordion">Can I choose the student I want<br > to host?</button>

                        <p>Yes! We will work with you to find the perfect student match based on your unique family. Let us know about your pets, hobbies, religion, allergies, or family heritage. If you have an idea of what type of student would fit best in your family, let’s talk about it!</p>

                    <button class="accordion">Are host families paid?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Host families are not paid. According to the U.S. Department of State, host families cannot receive financial gain from their participation in a student exchange program. This rule is designed to ensure that host families are participating in the program for the right reasons. However, in recognition of their role as citizen ambassadors, all host families are eligible to receive a charitable tax deduction on their tax return.</p>
