# Greenheart Las Vegas

This is a website I made for a foreign exchange coordinator in Las Vegas. She wanted a website to make it easier for people to get information, to contact her, and to apply to be a foreign exchange student. 

The site is built in PHP and Javascript. This project was the first time I built out a template to be used for each html page, and that saved me a lot of time, and was good practice for when I learned React components a year later.
