                    <p class="blueheaders">Thank You!</p>
                    <p>Thank you for submitting your application! Your application has been received.</p>
                    <p> Within 24 hours you will receive an email with information on how to log on to the official CCI Greenheart page. You will also receive a call from your Local Coordinator (LC) to answer any additional questions you may have.</p>
                    <p>Once you have logged into your account, you can begin the application process which involves 2 local references, background checks for everyone over 17 living in the home, pictures of your home and family, and other information about your family for your future student to see.</p>
                    <p>As you are working on your application, your LC will begin showing you student profiles for you to look over until you find one that is a good fit for your family.</p>
                    <p>If you are considering a student, your LC can put a hold on him/her that lasts for 5 days until you are sure youâ€™re ready to host.</p>
                    <p>Once you are sure you have found the right student, let your LC know. He/she will begin the process of getting approval from Clark County School District and compiling all the paperwork needed to finalize the process.</p>
                    <p>Normally within a month you will be able to communicate directly with your future exchange student!
                    <p>Feel free to contact your local Coordinator Bridgette Luman anytime at host@exchangestudentslasvegas.com or through the <a href="contact.html">contact page.</a></p>
